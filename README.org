* Sergio Migu√©ns Iglesias' CV

This is my fully free and open-source CV (check the LICENSE for details). It is based on a template by  Jan Vorisek.

** Compiling the document

To compile the CV you need to have =texlive= installed in your computer. Once you have it the you can run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make es
#+END_SRC

If you want to clean the prject just type:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make clean
#+END_SRC

** Notes on editing

The latex template uses many tricks to make the CV look the way it does. For example:
- minipage :: allows for two or more elements to coexists in the same horizontal space on the page.
- cvsect :: makes a title for a section.
- barchart/baritem :: displays a beautiful bar list.
